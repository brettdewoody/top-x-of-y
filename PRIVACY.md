# Privacy Policy

We take privacy extremely seriously. This is our policy as of Dec 31, 2019.

To create your photo collage we request the most basic permissions allowed by Instagram - granting us permission to retrieve your Instagram profile info and media. With this basic permission we **cannot** post any photos, videos, stories, or other media, or perform any actions on your behalf (e.g. this app cannot follow accounts, 'like' photos, or comment).

After creating your collage you may revoke this site's access immediately through your [Instagram Account page](https://www.instagram.com/accounts/manage_access/?hl=en). Revoking access ensures we cannot continue to access your profile info or media, which we do not do regardless.

We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal Instagram information, or your photo collage. We merely request and display your Instagram photos in a collage to you and only you.

Your collage can be created only by you, and shared only by you. Other users cannot create a collage of your most-liked photos on this site.
