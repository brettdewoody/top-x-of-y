## Code of Conduct

### Our Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple web application, using only modern browser technologies,
allowing a user to create a collage of their most popular Instagram photos - based on likes, with comments
as a tie-breaker.

The original version of the app was entirely client-based, but due to changes in the Instagram API in 2020 the app
requires a server call to authenticate the user. So this app now includes a simple serverless function call
to authenticate the user so their media can be retrieved.

Specifically:

1. The app will not import, require, or be dependent on any outside code, libraries or packages,
   with sole exception being the [Instragram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/)
2. The app should strive for simplicity in it's functionality, use, and codebase
