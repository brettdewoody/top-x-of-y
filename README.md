also serve as an example of what can be built with native, modern, browser technologies.

## About the app

The app is built using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are no dependencies, and no third-party libraries, imports or other external resources are limited to the [Instragram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) and a single Google Font.
